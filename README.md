# NDN-DPDK: High-Speed Named Data Networking Forwarder

NDN-DPDK is a set of high-speed [Named Data Networking (NDN)](https://named-data.net/) programs developed with the [Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)](https://www.dpdk.org/).
Included are a network forwarder, a traffic generator, and a file server.

This software is developed at the [Advanced Network Technologies Division](https://www.nist.gov/itl/antd) of the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/).
It is in pre-release stage and will continue to be updated.
